## 1270 BC: Pact of Athens

The pact of Athens was a document that detailed the theology of the ashen priesthood of the Via Humanitatis.

At approximately 1270 BC, a conclave of several early Prodigals, mostly including Brujah, Ventrue, Toreador and Salubri,  met at the city of Athens, because many of the attending vampires saw it as the official birthplace of the Road of Humanity itself. The pact of Athens acted as a formal guideline for the disparate currents in vampiric society that sought to stave off the beast and indulge their humanity.
