# Chapter three: Vampires

## Clan Brujah

Vampires of the Brujah clan have dwelled in Athens for thousands of years, attracted by its political vigor and the philosophical developments that have taken place in the city.

Following the death of Brujah in unrecorded history, the clan Brujah lived among the mortals, letting themselves revere as kings and gods, trying to recreate the glory of the [Second City](http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Second_City) and the harmony between the [Children of Seth](http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Children_of_Seth) and the childer of Caine. The first place that became an experiment of the Brujah was Greece, specifically Athens. Learning from and discussing their ideals with the Athenian orators and philosophers, the Brujah found countless impeti to improve society. The Brujah allowed other cainites to enter their city and to share Athens glory. Conflict withe spartan Ventrue, led to discord and the first Brujah War. After that, many of the praedicandi, the rulers of the Clan, left Greece, convinced that the experiment had failed and that they should start again elsewhere. Many of the praedicandi seized the moment and followed Troile's example, diablerizing their sires to leave no witnesses or patrons to what they regarded as a failure.

Given the current understanding between the Camarilla and the Sabbat, a very large amount of athenian vampires are actually Brujah.

### Athena

4th generation Brujah

The ancient greek goddess of wisdom, craft and war, Athena is the patron of the city of Athens. In ancient times, scholars argued whether Athena was named after Athens or Athens after Athena; now scholars generally agree that the goddess takes her name from the city.

Athena was venerated as the goddess of the city and the protectress of the citadel. Her power has waned a lot since the ancient times, but she still controls a large part of the city, as the de facto leader of the Brujah clan.

Athena is rarely ever seen in person, even by those closest to her, but her level of animalism is so high that she operates a large spy ring via her sacred bird, owls.

## Clan Lasombra 

### The "Athenian"

4th generation Lasombra

The athenian is an ancient Lasombra that has immersed himself so much in the city of Athens, that his real identity and name are now lost, even to him. Even though that he was a political powerful cainite, even in the early years of Athens, his rise to prominence as one of the city's true leaders, rival only to Athena and Apollo, went hand-in-hand with the rise of christianity in the region, during the years of the Byzantine empire.

The athenian hides in plain site, by disguising himself as a beggar in the streets of Athens. The only cainites that know of his existence are quite possibly his progeny, Apollo and Athena.

## The Twins

5th generation Lasombra

Camarilla and Sabbat vampires have a certain... understanding when it comes to Athens; it is considered a holy place under a constant truce from the fight between the two sects. However, both of them clain a large part of the city as their own and, thus, Athens is the only city that has both a prince and an archbishop.

Little do the cainites of Athens know, however, that these two vampires were mortal twins and were both embraced by the athenian. After the creation of the two sects, it was apparent that his city would not be left alone by them, due to its strategic importance, so he instead chose to create an elaborate plot to infiltrate both.

Thus he embraced two twin mortals: one became a Sabbat archbishop, while the other rose to the level of the prince of the city.

The twins have a common understanding that's beyond that of brothers: they have spent so much time together that they don't only act alike, but they consider themselves the same person; they might have two bodies, but they have only one spirit. Due to their clan weakness, looking at each other is the only way to see themselves "in the mirror" and they have spent endless nights doing just that.
