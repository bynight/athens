# The city

Elaborate on:

* Even though Athens doesn't differ much from other cities, people do go out during the night with more ease compared to the rest of the Europe; this turns out not to be only a cultural thing, but also has some supernatural roots \(e.g. high level presence powers by the city's elders\).
* The Lasombra clan always had a significant part of the city under its power; even though few Lasombra know how to create one, there are still in place countless of abyss portals scattered throughout the city. Obtenebration proficiency is not required to operate these portals, but few are brave enough to access them, even though it grants the user the ability to teleport.
